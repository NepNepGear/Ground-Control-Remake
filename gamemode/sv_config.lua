	if you wish to setup specific things for the gamemode ON THE SERVER, you should do it here
	this file will never be changed in future updates (except for being included in them), so you're free to adjust the gamemode as you see fit here 
	the code here will be run after everything in the gamemode has been initialized 
	
	this is also the best place for the "GroundControlPostInitEntity" hook (added with hook.Add as usual)
